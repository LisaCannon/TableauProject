# TableauProject

### Included in this repository is only the file of python code used to concatenate the csv files into one large file for use in Tableau.  The cvs resource files and the large output data set were too large to include in the repository.  If you wish to replicate the work, the data can be found at https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data.
